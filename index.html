            <h3>Welcome to the official UIP web portal.</h3>
            <p>Here you will find all that the UIP has to publicly offer. Information requests can be made if you would like source information, evidence, etc.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that information and materials that can be considered a threat to an individual, their security, or the security of the city/county/state/nation
                will not be released unless requested by a government employee.
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to request all information that involves you, make a standard request and attach 
                a photo of your picture ID, your face, and any other identity verification methods requested. We 
                do not release personal information discovered during investigations without proof of identity.
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to request the removal of a published paper, make a request as normal through the 
                general public requests page, then add a note stating you would like the paper removed permanently.
                You may need to confirm your identity to complete this process.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>While we carefully review all materials before publishing, things can slip through the cracks.
                If you notice a piece of sensitive information in a paper, contact us immediately and we will
                rectify the issue.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>If you would like to make a request for investigation, go through the general public requests page,
                then select "new investigation." If the request is legal and viable, it will be added to the queue.
                Remember to check the division your request will be investigated in.
            </p>
