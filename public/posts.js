        content: "We're currently setting up the systems of checks and balances to ensure everything is, and will remain, safe and legal at all times. At this time we are preparing all the technical manuals and modus operandi for the day to day within the UIP. At this time we aren't actually taking any new applicants. Once the system is ready for action, we will post on here and open up the official application pages. In the meanwhile, stay tuned here for the newest info. As you've probably noticed, the website isn't in fully operational shape. It will be ready in the following weeks.",
