            <h3>About the UIP</h3>
            <p>The UIP is a national team of independent researchers with a structured system of rules
                and protocols. It was created in 2019 with the goal of unifying individual researchers under
                a single banner to create high quality reports for public utilization. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Our internal laws require adept legal research and a strong vetting process to prevent
                publishing of any sensitive information. Our number one rule is safety. Not only for our
                agents, but for the subjects of our reports, and the nations they reside in. If a report
                is detrimental to the security of an individual or governmental body, we simply wont release it.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of our materials, regardless of security level, are available to government bodies on 
                request. This is to ensure full compliance with the law at all times.
            </p>
            <p><b>IMPORTANT: The UIP is in no way connected to any local or national government.</b></p>
            <h4>Q: What are the requirements to become an agent?</h4>
            <p>A: Due to the fact we aren't a business but rather a public program, 
                we have no major requirements besides some basic equipment requirements.
                We do however require an extensive training program for all new agents, during which
                we vet the potential agents behaviors to ensure there are no red flags. Agent's also 
                aren't allowed to self-publish their materials. This is to ensure all materials are 
                reviewed for sensitive information.
            </p>
            <h4>Q: How old do I have to be to join?</h4>
            <p>A: 18 years old is the minimum for agents. People 16 or older can however join for 
                training with special permissions.
            </p>
            <h4>Q: Can I make money in the UIP?</h4>
            <p>A: Not directly. However we will be offering a publishing service wherein our
                agents can publish large papers for charge at a rate of 90/5/5. 90% of the profits go to
                the author, 5% goes to the UIP for administration fees, and 5% goes to your divisions 
                administration as dues. These reports can be purchased by anyone but will be primarily 
                marketed towards industrial and governmental clients.
            </p>
